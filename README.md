# GPA-calculator
This is an entry-level project for learning Python that utilizes user input, lists, while loops, for loops and calculations.

Instead of using a calculator to determine your GPA with decimals to see you what you will recieve at the end of the semester, use this!  This program will take in a letter grade and give you a calulated average of what you could expect for you final grade point average.

# Developers
I plan on adding additonal features to my projects in the future as I continue to develop my python skills.  If you have any suggestions or how to refactor for cleaner or more efficent code, please let me know!
